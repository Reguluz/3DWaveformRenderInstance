# GPU3DWaveform

This is a project to render waveforms of the runtime played audio clip in scene by using compute shader. It is showed by amount of cubes with different lengths.

For some unsolved reason that just mono audios can be rendered correctly. I'm still trying to find the solution to support stereo audios.

You can use it in everywhere if you need, and the example song is made by myself. For the song is a doujin genre, it can't be used at other place, it's just a gift for you.
